I developed a 2D Minecraft game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game starts by generating a world with various blocks and materials. Players can add or remove blocks from their inventory, which is stored in an array. To simplify this process, I created a function that identifies the specific block class that players interact with, significantly reducing the amount of code required.

To add more depth to the game, I added an axe and three other materials, each with different permissions for removing specific types of blocks. The game includes a start page with three maps to choose from and a quiet game option. To enhance the overall gaming experience, I incorporated sound effects and music.

To access their inventory, players simply need to right-click their mouse. The items in the inventory are sorted based on which ones they used last. Finally, I included a feature to save the game state using local storage, allowing players to easily pick up where they left off.

Overall, the game provides an engaging and enjoyable experience for players.
