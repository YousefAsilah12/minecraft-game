2d minecraft game using html css js only 
so i will make it simple game not high level 
it will start by generating the map 
and then start to make the add remove block s
and will be added to the inventory or removed from the inventory
and will be 3 or 4 tools to add or remove depends on the type of the blocks were trying to add or remove


--stesps for work : 
  - Create the HTML structure for the game, including elements for the player, the inventory, and the world.

  - Style the game using CSS to give it a similar look and feel to Minecraft.

  - Use JavaScript to generate a random world, including blocks and materials.

  - Implement functionality for adding and removing blocks to the inventory, using an array to store the collected materials.

  - (optional)Create a basic player character with basic movements (left, right, up, down) using the arrow keys.

  - Implement the use of an axe and three other main materials, allowing the player to gather resources and shape the world.

  -  Store the game state using local storage so that the player can pick up where they left off.

  - Add sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.

  - Test and debug the game, fixing any issues that arise.




This is a basic outline, and you may want to add more features or change the details as you see fit. Good luck!

#when i did the add or remove at the first it was hard to implement i was using for each material in the inventory if and every one has maybe 5 lines of code * 20 material it will be to much lines of code
i was thinking to add way to make it shorter i made new function to get for me the specific class iam in it and now with 4 lines of code its can be done 

also i added permissions to the 4 tools that not every tool can remove any block
each one has different job
