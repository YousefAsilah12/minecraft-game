--stesps for work : 


  - Create the HTML structure for the game, including elements for the player, the inventory, and the world.

  - Style the game using CSS to give it a similar look and feel to Minecraft.

  - Use JavaScript to generate a random world, including blocks and materials.

  - Implement functionality for adding and removing blocks to the inventory, using an array to store the collected materials.

  - Create a basic player character with basic movements (left, right, up, down) using the arrow keys.

  - Implement the use of an axe and three other main materials, allowing the player to gather resources and shape the world.

  -  Store the game state using local storage so that the player can pick up where they left off.

  - Add sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.

  - Test and debug the game, fixing any issues that arise.




This is a basic outline, and you may want to add more features or change the details as you see fit. Good luck!
